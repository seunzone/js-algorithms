# js-algorithms

A way to becoming a great developer could be tied to how well you are able to solve algorithm questions.
This Repository contains solutions to popular JavaScript Algorithm questions.
Feel free to add your sollutions.
I hope to write my thought process on medium on how these solutions work.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/seunzone/js-algorithms.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

3. Run jest test for each algorithm, refer to the `package.json` file <br>
   Palindrome Test: `yarn run palindrome` See explanaition on medium click [here](https://medium.com/@darealseun/javascript-algorithms-part-1-palindrome-fdb1bf84eae7)<br>
   Reverse String Test: `yarn run rev-str` See explanaition on medium click [here](https://medium.com/@darealseun/javascript-algorithms-part-2-reversed-strings-and-integers-1cee9175d746)<br>
   Reverse Integer Test: `yarn run rev-int` See explanaition on medium click [here](https://medium.com/@darealseun/javascript-algorithms-part-2-reversed-strings-and-integers-1cee9175d746)<br>
   Maximumn Character Test: `yarn run maxchar` <br>
   FizzBuzz Test: `yarn run fizzbuzz` <br>
